Let's proceed with building a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived. We'll follow these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if necessary.
2. Feature Selection: Select the relevant features for the model.
3. Model Training: Split the data into training and test sets, then train a machine learning model.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
We'll start by checking for missing values and then encode categorical variables.

Check for Missing Values
Let's see which columns have missing values. ​​

We can see that:

The Age column has 177 missing values.
The Cabin column has 687 missing values.
The Embarked column has 2 missing values.
We will handle these missing values next.

For Age, we can fill missing values with the median age.
For Cabin, we will drop this column since it has too many missing values.
For Embarked, we can fill missing values with the most common port of embarkation.
Next, we will encode the categorical variables (Sex and Embarked.

1.Handle Missing Values:
  Fill missing Age values with the median.
  Drop the Cabin column.
  Fill missing Embarked values with the most common port.
2.Encode Categorical Variables:
  Convert Sex to numeric.
  One-hot encode Embarked.
  Feature Selection:
3.Select features: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked_Q, and Embarked_S
4.Model Training and Evaluation:
  Split the data into training and test sets.
  Train a model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
  Evaluate the model.
